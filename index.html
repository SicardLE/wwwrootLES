<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">This Father`s day, Sunday, June 20th, 2021, Noelle gave me a book - `This Life of Mine` - to fill out. It stores information from my perspective about events and observations occurring in my life.<BR/>
I hope I can pass this on to my family and hope it will give them insight, encouragement, and a few laughs.</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 2): Where I was born<BR/>
I was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts at the `old` Holyoke Hospital.   If I remember correctly, my brother, Brian - who is 4 1/2 years younger than me - was born in the `new` Holyoke Hospital.  The old one was replaced with a parking lot.  I was also told that the `new` Holyoke Hospital was also replaced.  I don`t know what replaced it.</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 3): My parents` names and birth dates<BR/><BR/>
My mom, Lorraine Eva Lavigne, was born on May 15, 1927<BR/><BR/>
My dad, Ernest Child Roy Sicard, was born on October 14, 1927. He was always called Roy, and he always signed his name `Roy C. Sicard`.  I don`t know if his name was changed to that form legally, but I think it always appeared in that form on documents.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 4): My sibling`s name and birth date<BR/><BR/>
Brian Philip Sicard was born on April 13, 1958.<BR/><BR/>
I remember that my mom and dad left me with Mr. Gauthier who Uncle Phil shared an apartment with.  We lived in the second floor apartment and Uncle Phil and Mr. Gauthier were above us on the 3rd floor.  I was 4 1/2 years old.<BR/><BR/>
Mr. Gauthier kept me occupied by giving me a bucket of water and a rag and told me to wash some furniture.  I remember sitting under a wooden pedestal table and trying to wash it.  I don`t think I liked doing that too much.<BR/><BR/>
I was really happy to see Brian come home from the hospital with Mom and Dad.<BR/><BR/>

Mom<BR/>
<a href="image/LorraineEvaLavigne-graduation.jpg" target="image/LorraineEvaLavigne-graduation.jpg"><img src="image/LorraineEvaLavigne-graduation.jpg" alt="My Mom" height="200" /></a><BR/><BR/>

Her favorite meal was pork chops (even more than steak).  When out at a restaurant she would eat about 1/2 of her meal then say she was full.  When the waitress came by and asked 
if anyone wanted dessert, my mom never refused it.<BR/><BR/>
Dad<BR/>
<a href="image/RoySicard.jpg" target="image/RoySicard.jpg"><img src="image/RoySicard.jpg" alt="My Dad" height="200" /></a>
<BR/><BR/>
My dad was born right-handed.  When he was young (I`m guessing 7 or 8 years old) he broke his right arm while imitating one of his movie cowboy heroes, Tom Mix.  He had placed his `skippy wagon` at the bottom of the steps of his grandmother`s porch - pretending it was a horse that he ran up to and jumped on.  The wagon flew out, and he fell back - breaking his arm.  Since he could not write with his right hand, he learned to be left-handed - which he was for the rest of his life.
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 9): Other family members who have impacted my life<BR/><BR/>
William Sicard - My cousin (Uncle Phil`s son) helped me through one of the roughest times of my life.  He helped my brother Brian when I couldn`t be there in Massachusetts to get him the care he needed when he was sick.  I am forever grateful to him.<BR/><BR/>
Uncle Phil (Jacques Philip Sicard) - Before he married Aunt Connie, he was living in the apartment upstairs from us.  He often showed me how to do things like work with tools.  One time he had a bat problem in his apartment and got a BB gun to take them out.  When he showed me how to use it and try it (I must have been around 9 years old) I put a hole through his kitchen window.  He did not tell my dad and told me not to mention anything about me using the BB gun.<BR/><BR/>
Christine Robert Piedra - My cousin (Aunt Claire and Uncle Harvey`s daughter) played guitar and sang.  She probably had a lot to do with my interest in learning to play guitar when I went to high school.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 13): Activities my family participated in together<BR/><BR/>
I was in 3rd grade when my dad thought we should try camping.  He bought these old, wool sleeping bags from a nearby army surplus store.  We went to a town in Vermont called White River Junction and camped one night on some public land along the White River (or maybe it was the Connecticut River because the town is where the White River joins the Connecticut River).  We slept in the sleeping bags inside our station wagon.  We liked it and the following year my dad invested in camping supplies: a big canvas tent, more comfortable sleeping bags, and everything else we needed.  My dad, mom, brother and I camped together until I moved off to college.<BR/><BR/>
We spent many of my dad`s 2-weeks summer vacation at the campground of Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison, Connecticut - right on the ocean.  This was our favorite camping spot, but other years we went to Lake Champlain in New York State, Fundy National Park on the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick with day trips including driving to parts of Nova Scotia.  My dad wanted to take the ferry to Prince Edward Island but we missed the ferry the day we went.  He always wanted to see the sights of PEI and the red sand beaches but we never got to.<BR/><BR/>
My dad also bought a boat - a 16 foot fiberglass tri-hull - for fishing and water skiing.  When we were not camping, we would go fishing, skiing, and picnicking on the Connecticut River (above the Holyoke dam where the water was a little cleaner) or various lakes, and sometimes fishing in the ocean (usually launching from Niantic, Connecticut).<BR/><BR/><a href="image/RoySicard-boat.jpg" target="image/RoySicard-boat.jpg"><img src="image/RoySicard-boat.jpg" alt="Dad`s Boat" height="200" /></a><BR/><BR/>

From Left: Lorraine (Mom), Bill, Jimmy, me, Roy (Dad), and Brian.<BR/><BR/>
In the fall of the year we often would go on Sunday rides through the mountains and sometimes stop at shops along highway 2 and pick up a bushel of Macintosh apples, cherries, or maple sugar candy.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 14): The best things about my family<BR/>
1: We always did things together, whether it was activities like camping, boating, skiing, fishing, going for car rides, visiting relatives and friends.<BR/><BR/>
2: Holidays - especially Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter - were great fun.  My best memories usually include times when we got together with aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents, or friends.  But even celebrating with my Mom, Dad, and brother alone were special to me.<BR/><BR/>
3: When my mom and dad would get mushy (usually my dad would make mom giggle) and in the middle of kissing and hugging he would spring a `gas leak` and mom would say `Oh Roy!`.<BR/><BR/>
4: My mom would play the piano and my dad would sometimes enter the room, stand beside her and he`d start singing.<BR/><BR/>
5: Brian was 4 1/2 years younger than me but I still liked hanging with him, whether it was playing with toys (like our road racing track) or listening to record albums.  The Christmas Day we got the road race kit, Brian and I played with it the rest of the day.  About 1/2 hour after we went to bed that night Brian and I could hear our road race cars in the other room.  Our Dad must have made his car bump Mom`s car off the track because she said `Oh Roy!  You stinker!`  d:^)<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 17): What summers were like growing up<BR/>
Summer vacation was almost always spent outside (weather permitting).  I spent many hours and miles on my bike and often hung out with the half dozen friends in my neighborhood and my brother. I did not get involved with any organized sports, but my friends played a lot of pick-up baseball or football. Hot days were spent at the pool; but hotter days would find us in the `Willow` movie theater - a couple blocks away - to see a couple cartoons and a double feature movie - all for 25 cents.
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 18): A childhood memory that stands out<BR/>
I was between 2 and 3 years old and lived in a duplex on Elcon Drive in Willimansett, Massachusetts with mom and dad.  I often watched my dad before he went to work.  I remember seeing him shave with a safety razor.  He would lather up his face with shaving cream and I watched as he would scrape the foam and whiskers from his face.  On the weekends he would not get up quite as early.  One Saturday in particular my dad woke up and he could hear a little noise of someone in the bathroom.<BR/><BR/>
I had walked into the bathroom and saw his razor and tried to shave.  I held the blade to my cheek and was ready to make the first swipe of imaginary whiskers.  Before I could pull the razor down my cheek my dad grabbed my wrist and pulled the razor away.  I had a little cut that I`m told left a scar that I could never find when I got old enough to shave - which was about 12 or more years later.<BR/><BR/>
Dad said that the scar would have probably been a lot more noticeable (and painful) if he had not caught me when he did.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 20): Schools I attended during childhood<BR/><BR/>
I went to Mount Carmel Elementary School, Mt. Carmel Ave, Willimansett, Massachusetts.<BR/><BR/>
Note: I had to learn to write a return address on mail I sent like this:<BR/><BR/>
   828 Chicopee Street<BR/>
   Willimansett, Massachusetts<BR/><BR/>
I did not learn the 4-letter state abbreviation (i.e. MASS) until my later years in that school.  I don`t think the 2-letter abbreviation (i.e. MA) or Zip Code 01013 existed at that time.
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 20): A teacher who had a great impact on me and why<BR/><BR/>
I was in the Novitiate house of the Blessed Sacrament Fathers in Barre Massachusetts starting in the Fall of 1971.  While there I took a few college courses - commuting to Holy Cross College in Worcester, MA.  Fr. Joseph Shea (SJ) was one of the professors of theology.  I was in his class on St. Thomas Aquinas.<BR/><BR/>
He and the subject matter he taught were very interesting, but I also learned the importance of exercising: both body and mind.  He came across as very bright and energetic in the classroom.  Once he asked if anyone knew how old he was.  I would have guessed that he was no more than 50 years based on his looks and stamina.  He was 75 years old at that time.<BR/><BR/>
One of the things he thought was a good mind exercise was the use of memory.  That stuck with me since that time.<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 22): Activities I enjoyed<BR/><BR/>
When I was young, I always tried to ice skate in the winter, but I never got the knack of it and could barely move around on the ice.  When I was a senior in high school and the winter temperatures dropped enough, I was asked to help water the outdoor skating rink.  I did not have skates at that time so I just watched my classmates play hockey.<BR/><BR/>
One of the freshmen was a very tall guy that went on the ice using his brand new skates for the first time that Winter of 1970.  After a few minutes he fell on the ice and broke his leg.  That was the end of his skating for that year.<BR/><BR/>
I was one of the guys helping him off the ice and I noticed that his skates were just my size.  I later asked him if I could borrow them.  He agreed to lend them to me.  I gave skating a new try with a new plan.  I was going to attempt to skate with a hockey stick in my hand.  Little by little I took to the ice and focused on the puck instead of my skating.  In less than a week I was speeding around the rink - skating forwards and backwards like I never had before.<BR/><BR/>
I was not the best skater (I dare say I was at least average) but I could hold my own on the ice and was good enough to compete with my classmates.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 23): Post-high school education, training, or degrees<BR/><BR/>
I graduated from St. Norbert College (Cum laude) in May 1977 with a BA degree in mathematics.<BR/><BR/>
My math professors were Gene DeBoth, Richard Poss, and David Pankratz (who was also my math degree advisor).<BR/><BR/>
On my first day at St. Norbert, I met with Dr. Pankratz.  He asked me where I was from.  When I said Massachusetts, he said `No you`re not`, because I did not sound like someone from Boston.  I explained that I was from Western Massachusetts where we talk normal.  We got along great!
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 30, a): The friends I have known the longest and how we met<BR/><BR/>
John<BR/><BR/>
When I was about 3 or 4 years old, my mom, dad, and I moved from the duplex on Elcon Drive to 828 Chicopee Street.  This was a 4-story, 8-family apartment building.  Our apartment was on the 2nd floor, North side of the building.  The South apartment was occupied by the Thibodeau family.  The parents, Wesley and Gladys, had one boy, John, at that time who was about 4 years older than me.  In spite of that difference in age, we became good friends over time.<BR/><BR/>
He was very bright in school and he seemed to like math and sciences most.  I had the same subject preferences in school but now I think it was John that caused me to develop those interests.  Hanging out with John was always very interesting.  He taught me a lot of different things, like: how to use his microscope; how to play chess and other adult board games; how to use a slide rule.  It felt that he must have found me interesting enough to share things he learned in high school with me, even though I was four years his junior in school.
When he went to college, I didn`t see him as much - mostly just during summer vacations.  We`d still see each other and he shared his preference of rock music when we caught up on each other`s lives.<BR/><BR/>
It has been quite a few years since I saw him last but I hope to catch up with him the next time I am able to visit Massachusetts.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 30, b): The friends I have known the longest and how we met<BR/><BR/>
Chris<BR/><BR/>
I went to a minor seminary high school in Fall of 1967.  It was run by the Catholic priests and brothers of Blessed Sacrament religious order.  This boarding school was in the town of Hyde Park, New York (a little North of the city of Poughkeepsie, NY).  It was roughly 100 miles from my home in Chicopee, MA.  One of my classmates was Chris Pariseau.  I thought of him as having these qualities: friendly, athletic, loud, short (sorry Chris).  After 4 years of high school, we both continued on with the Blessed Sacrament religious at the novitiate house in Barre, MA (which was only about 50 miles East of Chicopee).  He spent the usual 2 years there and advanced to the Blessed Sacrament major seminary in Cleveland, Ohio.  I remained in Barre for another 1 1/2 years.  
I saw him a couple times while he was in Cleveland.  On one of those visits (I believe it was Summer of 1974), I met a couple friends of his that we played tennis with.  One of those girls was named Paula.<BR/><BR/>
Chris did not stay in the seminary.  I did not see him after I left the novitiate in Barre and moved to St. Mary Parish in Menasha, Wisconsin in January of 1975.<BR/><BR/>
My focus with the Blessed Sacrament community (who staffed the parish and some of whom were on the teaching staff of St. Mary High School) was to complete my college studies here.  Because of low enrollment in Cleveland, OH, the seminary was closed.  My major seminary studies were to take place in Menasha instead.
Another of my duties was to assist Father Roland Laliberte with church liturgies.  This was to give me the experience of parish life for a priest.  I decided to leave the Blessed Sacrament order in the Spring of that year.  However, I did not leave Menasha.  Instead I decided to complete college and graduated from, St. Norbert College in May of 1977.  That was not the only reason I decided to stay in Wisconsin, but that is another story which is another chapter for this journal.<BR/><BR/>
A few years after I graduated, I heard from Chris.  He had joined the Navy and was in basic training at Great Lakes Naval Base (near Milwaukee, I think).  Kate and I decided to try visiting him but when we got there, he had already shipped out.  I did not hear from him after that.<BR/><BR/>
Skip ahead 22 years<BR/><BR/>
A conversation with one of my friends from Menasha prompted me to think about Chris and one day while working as a programmer at Kimberly-Clark Corporation, I was using a web site to research a software vendor.  I thought `If I can find a company with a web search, why couldn`t I find a person?`  I searched for Christopher Pariseau by name.  The results were numerous.  Even when I limited it to the state of Massachusetts there were about 6 hits with that name.  I noticed that one of the results listed a phone number under the name `Christopher and Paula Pariseau`.  I thought: could it be that Chris married the Paula from Cleveland?<BR/><BR/>
I got up the nerve (aka a can of beer) to call the number.  What sounded like a young teenage girl answered the phone.  I gave her my name and explained why I was calling - telling her that I was searching for my friend Chris and asking if she would give him the message.  If he did not know me, then I was sorry to be a bother.  She said he was not home at that time, but she would give him the message.<BR/><BR/>
The next day, Chris called me back.  It was he!  We talked for a while and said that someday we would need to get together, catch up with our lives, and introduce our families.  Within the next few years we visit Chris and his family at his home while we took our kids to see the sights of Washington DC.  Chris and Paula also visit us in Neenah, WI.  We have not traveled to his home since, but we keep in touch by phone, mail, and Facebook.
One thing I noticed about SOME friends: when you don`t see someone for many years, they give off a vibe and a look at you as if you are a stranger again.  That was not the case with Chris; we were glad to see each other and it felt as if we were apart only days (instead of 22 years).<BR/><BR/>

</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 31): Friends who have been there for me when I needed them most<BR/><BR/>
Dave Thiede<BR/><BR/>
I first met Dave when joined the Blessed Sacrament (SSS) order at the Novitiate in Barre, MA in 1971.  He was from Menasha, Wisconsin and had just finished his service in the US Army in Vietnam.  After Novitiate, Dave moved to the SSS house in Old Town, Maine for a couple years.  In the meantime, I finished at the Novitiate and moved to St. Mary Parish in Menasha, WI.  I had left the SSS order and after a time heard that Dave left the SSS order as well, and then he returned to Menasha to live with his folks at their home on London Street also in Menasha.<BR/><BR/>
Dave was always a good friend and we hung out often.  The greatest test of our friendship occurred after I married Kathy Stanton on May 5, 1978.  As Christmas 1978 approached, I needed to do serious shopping for a woman for the first time in my life.  Dave stopped by our house one afternoon in early December and it had just started lightly snowing.  I asked Dave: `Would you go to the store with me?  I need to do a little shopping.`  He said `Sure.`  Now, that is a good friend!<BR/><BR/>
But wait...there is more<BR/><BR/>
Dave drove me in his car and we went to the Treasure Island store on College Ave, Appleton, WI.  I had some ideas on what I was looking for as Christmas presents for my wife.  I told Dave that I wanted to get a full length nightgown.  Since, like I said earlier, I never shopped for a woman before and knew nothing about lady`s sizes.  What I did know was that Dave and Kathy were exactly the same height, 5` 2”.  I asked `Dave, come over here for a minute.` I held a nightgown I picked from the rack up to his neck.  It took a couple tries to find the right size.<BR/><BR/>
Just then, I noticed a lady had stopped nearby and looked at us in an odd way - a look that seemed like a mixture of surprise and maybe a little of disgust - before she continued to walk by.  I put my choice of nightgown in the cart.  Next: on to the rack of bathrobes...<BR/><BR/>
Dave`s height came in handy, and I used him to measure bathrobe lengths as well.  It looked like a good choice so I placed it in the cart.  When I looked up, the same lady walked by again: not saying a word but still having that same look on her face.
We walked toward the store entrance but I still wanted to get one more gift: perfume.  I didn`t know any perfumes by brand name so I picked up a tester bottle and sprayed a little on my wrist. I didn`t like that one. Tried the next one by spritzing my inner elbow and thought that one was too strong.  After spraying every possible spot on each of my arms with about 1/2 dozen tester bottles or more, I ran out of places to test.  I said `Dave, would you come over here for a minute?`  I tried a few more samples on his arms and finally found one that I liked that smelled pretty good.  I looked up to tell Dave that I was ready to check out and...yes, that same lady happened to walk by again, shook her head and walked off.<BR/><BR/>
We walked to the parking lot, got in the car, and started to leave.  It was still cold outside but Dave said `Open your window ` and as he opened his window exclaimed `It smells like a French whorehouse in here.`<BR/><BR/>
Kathy seemed to enjoy her gifts so I considered my first-time Christmas shopping a success.<BR/><BR/>
The following year, Dave had stopped by the house to visit.  I asked if he would go Christmas shopping with me again.  He said `HELL NO!`<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 37): How and when we met<BR/><BR/>
Kathleen Mary Stanton<BR/><BR/>
I moved from the Blessed Sacrament Novitiate in Barre, Massachusetts to Menasha, Wisconsin on January 15, 1975 when I was 21 years old.  I drove alone on interstate highway 90 to Chicago, IL and turned North, traveling another 3 1/2 hours or so on highway 94, then on 41 after passing through Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and finally reaching Menasha.<BR/><BR/>
Over the next few days getting to know the Blessed Sacrament priests and brothers who staffed St. Mary Parish, I was introduced to some of the local people who were parishioners.  I had a couple weeks to use for meeting locals, getting to know what everyone was involved in: some priests staffed the parish (Frs. Louis Prefontaine, Bob Lussier, and Roland Laliberte),  others were teachers at St. Mary High School (Frs. Mike Noreika and Norman Pelletier).  Brother Edmund Hardy was the cook.  I believe Fr. Rob Baldoni was a resident of the SSS community but was retired.<BR/><BR/>
For the rest of the month of January (until the Spring 1975 semester began) I would serve at daily morning mass.  I met and was introduced to several parishioners who attended and got to know a few.  One of the couples was Bud and Gladys Stanton.  They were very friendly and I would speak to them occasionally after mass.  Once I started classes at St. Norbert College in Depere, WI, I did not have time to serve daily mass so that I could travel and arrive in time for my first class.<BR/><BR/>
I had been singing and playing guitar at masses prior to moving to Menasha (since 1967 when I was in the SSS Minor Seminary) so I inquired about how to join St. Mary`s choir (not the adult choir, but the guitar group).  I found that the guitar group was primarily made up of the Phillips family and a few others - including Chuck Klein, Tom Klein, Kathy Stanton, etc.).  I was welcomed into the group (without an audition) and would join them twice weekly: once on Wednesday evenings for a practice session, and then at 10:30 AM Sunday morning for the mass.<BR/><BR/>
After having been with the group for a couple months and getting to know them better, some of the adult members invited me to go with them to participate in local activities.  Chuck, Tom, Kathy, and I enjoyed the live bands in the area and eventually sought out our favorites - one of which was a band called `The Friends` which did a lot of 50`s and 60`s rock tunes and were fun to listen to.<BR/><BR/>
Besides school, I tried to immerse myself in parish activities, especially assisting Fr. Roland Laliberte where I could.  Brother Edmund also took me along to show me his ministry of visiting hospital patients, visiting shut-in people at their homes, etc.  I did not regret doing any of that work but I decided in the end that it wasn`t the life that I wanted.  So at the end of the school semester, I told the community that I was leaving the order.  I would remain in Menasha until I graduated from St. Norbert but I would be getting a job, finding place to live, and moving out of the rectory.<BR/><BR/>
I traveled home to be with my parents for a couple weeks and talk to them about my decision to leave the SSS order and my plans to complete college in Depere.  When I returned I changed my major to Mathematics.<BR/><BR/>
That is how we met.<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg ??): About my brother<BR/><BR/>
Brian Philip Sicard<BR/><BR/>
Brian was born on April 13, 1958 (4 1/2 years younger than me).<BR/><BR/>
In spite of our age difference we got along great.  We had similar interests in hobbies, music, and other activities.  Our differences: Brian was more outgoing and intellectual than me.  He was an avid reader.  He could tell stories and jokes a not bore anyone.  I could stumble telling a joke and no one would laugh; Brian would tell the same joke - word for word - and everyone laughed.<BR/><BR/>
When I went away to high school, it seemed like we got more distant in more ways than physical location.  I was saddened by that.<BR/><BR/>
I loved Brian. I loved my Dad. Brian and I did not have the same relationship with Dad. Brian seemed to think of my Dad as very controlling.<BR/><BR/>
Throughout our childhood Dad would talk to us (almost daily it seemed) about his life: adventures, the army, girlfriends, but, most importantly, about what he thought would be good choices for our future. I took Dad`s thoughts as great suggestions. It seemed Brian took it as Dad “...doing all my thinking for me.”
Here is an excerpt from the first of Brian`s 9 journals (which he started writing while in college in St Louis, MO).<BR/><BR/>

After the summer of 1975 ended, I boarded at St. Norbert college in Depere, Wisconsin.  I had no car and lived on campus full time in the 3M men`s dormitory - with a view of East Depere over the Fox River.<BR/><BR/>

A short while after the Fall semester began, I was invited to stay with Kate`s sister, Beth and her husband, Steve, on some weekends so that I could attend mass at St. Mary Church and still play guitar with the Phillips family group.  I was sometimes invited to Bud and Glady`s home for Sunday dinner - which was a great opportunity for a home-cooked meal (no offense to St. Norbert cooking Dan).<BR/><BR/>

These weekends also gave me an opportunity to get to know Kate better.  At some time during the next 2 years (before the time I graduated in May 1977) we were a couple.

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 39): What we do for fun<BR/><BR/>
Kathy and I grew up in families that liked the outdoors and mostly summer activities, like: camping, hiking, picnics, etc.  While camping, we sometimes pull out the guitars and sing around the campfire.<BR/><BR/>
More recently we added 4-wheeling to our activities and we will be doing more of it once we learn where the fun trails are.<BR/><BR/>

Kathy Stanton and I were engaged on Friday, September 23, 1977.  I gave her a diamond ring that was custom made by Sawotka`s on College Avenue,  Appleton, Wisconsin (I believe the business had moved out of Appleton many years ago).  Kathy and I went to her parents` house first.  We called my parents in Westfield, Massachusetts afterwards.<BR/><BR/>
After that, we went to Oshkosh to our friends` house to tell them the news.  When we got there it appeared that a party was going on because of the several cars parked outside.<BR/><BR/>
We knocked and our friends welcomed us in and we made our announcement.  We did not want to crash their party, so we planned to stay for no more than 15 minutes.<BR/><BR/>
Kathy noted that there was an unfamiliar, sweet aroma in the air and asked me if I knew what it was.  I said yes; it was an aroma I encountered when I was in college (need I say more?), and we did not stay there for more than 10 minutes.<BR/><BR/>
When people later asked if we did anything special to celebrate our engagement, we told them we went to a pot party.  d:^)<BR/><BR/>

Kathy and I were married on Friday evening at 7:00 PM, May 5, 1978.  My Mom, Dad, brother Brian, and Aunt Clare (Mom`s sister) attended the wedding and visit for a few days before and after the wedding day.  After they left to go back to Massachusetts, Kate and I packed up our camping gear and went to Hartmann Creek State Park in Waupaca, Wisconsin on our honeymoon (I believe it was on Monday).<BR/><BR/>
We had a little 3-person backpacker tent.  It was cold...very cold.<BR/><BR/>
The next morning I got up, made a campfire, and put on a pot of coffee.  It was still cold...very, very cold.  It was then that I first learned that the month of May in Wisconsin is still considered “Winter”.<BR/><BR/>
The cold must have affected my memory, because I don`t remember staying in the tent the second night.  We decided to go home and try camping a little while later...like, in June...late June.  d:^)<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 42): How we keep our relationship alive<BR/><BR/>
Here are some things Kathy and I decided would be good rules to follow as a married couple:<BR/><BR/>
  - Do things together: sometimes things that she likes, sometimes things that I like, and sometimes things we both like;<BR/>
  - Communicate: talk about things that bother us and try to compromise when we disagree;<BR/>
  - Do not go to bed angry;<BR/>
  - Do not assume the other person knows how you feel.  For example, when necessary, say:<BR/>
    - `I love you,`<BR/>
    - `I`m sorry,` or<BR/>
    - `I love you more!`<BR/>
  - Make the other person laugh ... a lot!

Although there are times when - as my kids grew up - they showed attributes similar to me and Kathy (as well as other members of our families), each is still unique in my mind.  If I could just use 2 words to describe each, this is what I see:<BR/><BR/>
Noelle Marie - organized; gentle<BR/><BR/>
Lauren Elissa - practical; strong<BR/><BR/>
Carrie Beth - diplomatic; religious<BR/><BR/>
Samuel Roy - logical; dedicated<BR/><BR/>
Anna Marie - lovable; sensitive<BR/><BR/>
Dominique Lorraine - bright; kind<BR/><BR/>
Brynn Therese - sympathetic; fiery<BR/><BR/>
I regard these as good, positive qualities. I hope each of my kids realize that - as members of the same family - these qualities can be shared with each other.<BR/><BR/>
I have tried to learn from them as well.<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 47): How being a parent changed me (or why I don`t like to travel by airplane)<BR/><BR/>
The first time I rode in an airplane I was about 14 years old.  My Mom, Dad, my brother, and I were spending the day picnicking and water skiing on the Connecticut River near Hatfield, Massachusetts like we did many times during the summer.  While sitting on the shore a small single-engine sea-plane landed on the river and pulled up to the shore not far from us.  Brian and I followed my Dad who walked to the plane and spoke to the pilot briefly.  Dad came back to us and asked if we wanted to go for a plane ride.  Of course we said `Yes!`.<BR/><BR/>
We got in and the plane started going up river - still on the water - until we went around a bend in the river.  The pilot pushed the throttle lever to full and we were speeding up, bouncing on the waves, and heading right for the Hatfield Bridge.  That was exciting!  We cleared the bridge and went up and up.<BR/><BR/>
The pilot asked us where we lived.  We told him that we lived in Willimansett.  In about 5 minutes or so he told us to look down and we could see our town.  We flew around for about 20 or 30 minutes before we headed back to the river.<BR/><BR/>
The landing was amazingly smooth (unlike the take-off).  All I could think was that I loved flying: so much so that I thought I would join the Air Force some day so I could fly a faster plane, like the F-105 Fighter jet.<BR/><BR/>
After I was married and started having children, I found it more and more difficult to step into an airplane.  The fear of flying started slowly: at first I would only require a window seat to put me at ease; later it built into a feeling of dread where I would feel physically ill weeks before a scheduled trip; and finally, I could not step onto a plane and would travel by bus or train instead.<BR/><BR/>
[FYI: This fear started well before the events of 2001-09-11.]

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 65): Three of my favorite foods as a child<BR/><BR/>
I have had many `favorite` foods as a child but I`m limiting my top 3 to those that my Mom or Dad cooked from scratch.  Here are they are.<BR/><BR/>
1. Spaghetti - Mom made this recipe that she learned from a good friend - Annie Dupere (she was Italian, but her husband, John, was French).  The recipe is simple, and my version is close to what my Mom made with these exceptions: she always browned and drained some ground beef in the kettle; I left the meat out and filled a glass of red wine and poured 1/2 of it into the sauce to neutralize the acidity of the tomatoes (and because the tomatoes did not like to drink alone).<BR/><BR/>
2. Macaroni and Cheese - This recipe calls for elbow pasta, Velveeta brand cheese, and a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes.  To save time, I use diced tomatoes.  In a 9x13 inch pan, I use about 3 cups of uncooked elbows macaroni and most of a block of cubed Velveeta.  I use Basil and a little pepper to season (no salt because the cheese is salty enough).<BR/><BR/>
3. Ragout - I believe this is a French-Canadian recipe which is basically meat balls and pork Hocks in a thick, browned flour gravy.  My Mom and Dad would work on its preparation together.  Dad would sear about 1/2 dozen or so pork hocks in a skillet.  Then he would remove the meat and put flour in same skillet and cook the flour until it was slightly browned.  Mom would make lots of meat balls out of ground beef and pork (I think) with other spices.  The meat balls would be cooked in the oven.  Finally, the gravy would be made from the flour with more herbs and spices and pork hocks and meat balls added to the kettle where it would simmer for a long time until the hocks were tender.<BR/><BR/>
The first meal we would have 1 pork hock each, a couple meat balls, and some gravy poured over boiled (or mashed) potatoes.  The second meal would be just meat balls, potatoes and gravy (because the hocks were usually gone before the end of the first meal).  Any subsequent meals were probably just gravy and potatoes.<BR/><BR/>
This recipe I found gives you an idea of how the meat balls and gravy are made.  It does not include the pork hocks. Check out this link:<BR/><BR/>

</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 65): Memorable meals my parents made when I was a child<BR/><BR/>
There are probably others that I don`t mention, but here are a few:<BR/><BR/>
- Pan fried steak in butter with a slice of bread browned in the steak-flavored butter;<BR/><BR/>
- Fish Cakes - Tuna mixed with leftover mashed potatoes, shaped like hamburgers, browned in hot oil, and eaten with ketchup;<BR/><BR/>
- Home-made French Fries - Mom cut up peeled potatoes with a crinkle knife.  She would deep fry them in bacon fat she saved in a coffee can and put them in a brown grocery bag, salt them, and shake the bag to remove most of the grease.  To this day, I have never tasted better French fries.<BR/><BR/>
  Note that we only had these every 2 or more months because it took that long to save enough bacon grease to fill the coffee can.<BR/><BR/>
- Blood Sausage - As a kid, I never realized what the sausage was made of (in spite of its name) until I was a lot older.  Still, that knowledge never deterred me from liking it.  Mom served it with mashed potatoes and a veggie.<BR/><BR/>
- Chuck Roast on the Hibachi (while camping) - During my Dad`s 2-week vacation in the summer we would go tent camping.  He did ALL the cooking during that time.  The most memorable of the meals he prepared was a 1 1/2 inch thick chuck roast that he cooked on a Hibachi charcoal grill.  My Dad knew how to pick meat for tenderness and flavor and I remember those times we had this meal that the meat was as flavorful and tender as the most expensive cuts of meat at the best restaurants I visited.<BR/><BR/>
- Dad`s Pancakes - My Dad made the best pancakes ever.  I am sorry to say I did not inherit his recipe and have never had pancakes to surpass his.  They were fluffy, had a unique taste, and big enough to fill a dinner plate.  In my mind I can still see him at the stove with the cast iron skillet in his hand and flipping the pancake - without a using spatula - by tossing it 2 or 3 feet into the air.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 72): Ways I express my creativity<BR/><BR/>
I always thought of myself as a problem solver (maybe having the potential as an inventor).  When attempting to fix or enhance something, I would more often prefer to try something that came out of my imagination rather than looking it up in a book or other source.  That was not always the case later in my life.<BR/><BR/>
In my career as a computer programmer, I feel that much of my creativity came out in project solutions.  It is probably that which held my interest for the 40 years in that career.<BR/><BR/>
I also wanted to try more typical artistic expressions through painting - specifically, water color painting.  I have yet to start that endeavor (maybe I will this year).<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 73): My hobbies and passions<BR/><BR/>
Playing guitar:<BR/><BR/>
  I remember my cousin Christine Robert played a guitar and sang along when I was in elementary school - which was probably what first interested me in the instrument. When I started high school in September 1967 the guitar mass at the school chapel was the second incentive that prompted me to ask Dad for a 6-string guitar.  He bought me a Harmony 3/4 size guitar - which was just the right size for me at the age of 13 (and a height of 5 ft. even).<BR/><BR/>
My sophomore year I grew about 8 inches and I imagined I looked somewhat nerdy with what I perceived as too small.  In spite of that fact, I kept endeavoring to improve my playing.<BR/>
After high school graduation and shortly after the start of the fall college semester I traded my Harmony towards the purchase of a C. F. Martin D18 6-string.  Sometime between that time and the next year I decided that I wanted a 12-string; so I traded in the 6-string for a C.F.Martin D12-18 - which I still have to this day.  I think one reason I wanted a 12-string is after I heard one at the `America` concert on November 22, 1974 at the College of the Holy Cross Fieldhouse, Worcester, MA.<BR/><BR/>
<img src="image/AmericaConcert-22Nov1974.jpg" alt="America Concert - 22 Nov 1974" height="450" /></a><BR/><BR/>

Fast forward to 1978 and the love-of-my-life (and wife), Kathy Stanton, gave me a gift of a new C.F.Martin D35 6-string.  It is a beautiful instrument and always a reminder of how we first met when I became a new member of the St. Mary of Menasha guitar choir.<BR/><BR/>
For many years we played and sang together in church, around campfires, etc.: first - just the two of us; later - with our 7 children.<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 78): The importance of reading in my life<BR/><BR/>
I was not much of a reader until I was an adult.  Even in high school I would procrastinate English class reading assignments.  During my four years of high school I recall reading about 4 books which I was not required to read.  Some of them were:<BR/><BR/>
- Instant Replay by Jerry Kramer<BR/>
- 2001 A Space Odyssey by Arthur C. Clarke<BR/>
- The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty<BR/><BR/>
It wasn`t until I was close to 30 that I starting getting into science fiction - the first book was a Star Wars continuation by Timothy Zahn.  To this day I still enjoy sci-fi but I also enjoy good mystery and drama stories.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 79.1): Genres (of books) I most enjoy<BR/><BR/>
I am drawn to science fiction mostly.  I was not much for reading until I was around 30 years old.  Some of my favorite authors include: Arthur C Clarke, Timothy Zahn, Charles Sheffield.<BR/><BR/>
In high school I remember only reading 3 books (which were not part of the school curriculum): 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Exorcist, and another which I believe the title is Instant Replay written by Jerry Kramer about his time with the Green Bay Packers (not science fiction...I know...I know).<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 80.1): Instruments I have played <BR/><BR/>
My Mom gave me piano lessons starting when I was 5 years old (I think); but I quit when I was about 7 years old.<BR/><BR/>
When I started high school I wanted a guitar.  My dad bought me a 3/4 size Harmony 6-string guitar which lasted me through my 4 years of high school.<BR/><BR/>
After I graduated I thought I looked kind of goofy with that size guitar - probably because I was 5 feet in height as a freshman and by the time I graduated I was a little over 6 feet tall.  So in 1971 I bought a 6-string C F Martin model D18 (for $275) from Union Music store in Worcester, Massachusetts.<BR/><BR/>
In 1973 I decided to trade it in for a D12-18 C F Martin 12-string guitar (for $325).<BR/><BR/>
Over the years I also learned how to play chords on the piano but I never really learned to read music well.  I regret that as much as I regret not being proficient at the piano.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 80.2): Instruments I wish I had learned to play <BR/><BR/>
When I was about 5 years old, my mom thought she would give me piano lessons.  She started me using the first (beginner) book in the John W. Schaum Piano Course series.<BR/><BR/>
My mom told me that she first started getting serious about piano playing when she was 16 years old.  She had a job playing at a dance school playing piano accompaniment for dance classes.<BR/><BR/>
<a href="image/Lorraine-Piano-2.jpg" target="image/Lorraine-Piano-2.jpg"><img src="image/Lorraine-Piano-2.jpg" alt="Mom at the piano" height="200" /></a><BR/><BR/>

When she was older, she joined an orchestra - Pizzitola Plectro Symphony.  In the following photo, see if you can find my mom and my Aunt Claire.<BR/><BR/>

[HINT: My mom is standing and holding a bass (she didn`t play it; she just couldn`t hold the piano for the picture); Aunt Clair is holding a mandolin and is seated near the middle of the picture.]<BR/><BR/>
My mom also gave piano lessons and I remember some of her students coming to our apartment for those.  I guess she thought if she could teach strangers to play that I could be taught as well.<BR/><BR/>
Unfortunately, I did not follow in my mom`s footsteps because I quit lessons when I was around 7 years old.  Not much later in life I sometimes wished mom would have pushed me to stick with the piano.<BR/><BR/>
Oh well...I still have my guitars.
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 81.1): The first concert I attended<BR/><BR/>
I was in elementary school (probably in 7th grade) and our class went to listen to the Boston Pops (or possibly to the Boston Symphony Orchestra [see note below]) concert program in April 1965 at the Municipal Auditorium, Springfield.  According to the archives there was a concert scheduled for Tuesday, April 6, 1965 at 8:00pm, so my class may have attended a rehearsal session that morning (which is just my guess).<BR/><BR/>
<img src="image/Boston Symphony Orchestra .jpg" alt="Boston Symphony Orchestra concert" height="200" />
<BR/><BR/>
Regardless of the details, the concert was amazing.  It was my first (and only occasion thus far) that I attended a professional performance of this caliber in person.  I may forget the names of the orchestra, director, pieces played, but I will never forget the feeling I experienced listening to classical music.
<BR/><BR/>
* Note: The Boston Pops consists primarily of musicians of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, one of the finest orchestras in the world (although many of the principal players do not play in the Pops). Hence, far from being “below average,” the level of musicianship is far above average.<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 81.2): The most memorable concert I attended and why <BR/><BR/>
The Paul Winter Consort at St. Norbert College, DePere WI (1976 or 1977) was a unique concert that I had not ever experienced prior or since.  What was most memorable was an amazing electric cello player and a xylophone-like instrument that looked like huge tree logs. </TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 81.3): Songs, albums, or bands that were part of my youth <BR/><BR/>
I did not own very many music albums, and in my pre-teen and teen years, some of the ones I listened to at home probably belonged to my brother Brian. Here is a list of some (but not all) my favorites of those years (1963 through 1971):<BR/><BR/>
Singles<BR/>
 - Wipe Out - The Surfaris 1963<BR/>
 - Back in USSR - Beatles 1968<BR/>
 - Let It Be - Beatles 1969<BR/>
 - Won`t Get Fooled Again - The Who 1971<BR/><BR/>
Albums (which Brian or I owned)<BR/>
 - Head (The Monkees album) 1968<BR/>
 - Grand Funk Railroad - Live Album 1970<BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 95): Places I have lived and what I remember most vividly about them <BR/><BR/>
<BR/>
When I was first born and until I was probably around 1 year old, my parents and I lived in a three story, three family apartment on Lucretia Ave in Willimansett, MA.  I have no memories of living there.<BR/>
<BR/>
The next place I lived was in a duplex on Elcon Drive in Willimansett until I was around 4 years old. I do have some memories there:<BR/>
1. I remember cutting my cheek with my dad`s razor (a story which I told in another entry of this journal);<BR/>
2. I remember following my dad out the front door when he was going to wash the car.  I picked up the nozzle end of the hose while my dad went to turn on the water and I got sprayed in the face.  I think dad laughed;<BR/>
3. One day I was in the back yard playing when older kids walked by and crossed the main street that Elcon Drive was connected to - Meeting House Road.  I started following the kids but my mom must have seen me do this ran out to get me.  The next thing I remember was being tied at the waist with a length of rope: the other end tied to a tree in our yard.<BR/>
<BR/>
When I was about 4 years old, we moved to 828 Chicopee Street in Willimansett - where we lived through my high school years and novitiate. My mom and dad moved to Westfield after I had moved to Menasha, Wisconsin.</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 96): Most surprising or unique childhood vacation or outing <BR/><BR/>
Starting when I was in 3rd grade, my dad began taking the family camping.  We had a couple trial runs. The very first outing was sleeping overnight in the back of a station wagon in wool army sleeping bags next to the Connecticut River near Northfield, Massachusetts. The second outing was 2 nights near White River Junction, Vermont.<BR/><BR/>
We all enjoyed it so my dad bought a tent and other gear - including better sleeping bags with air mattresses. After being better equipped, we started going to Hammonasett Beach State Park in Madison, Connecticut - which we did for 2 weeks, 8 years in a row.<BR/><BR/>
<a href="image/HammonasettBeachStatePark.jpg" target="image/HammonasettBeachStatePark.jpg"><img src="image/HammonasettBeachStatePark.jpg" alt="Hammonasett Beach State Park, Madison, CT" height="200" /></a><BR/><BR/>

The campground was about a 10 minute walk to the ocean/beach.  After I was a couple years older, dad would allow Brian and I to got to the beach (not to swim alone) but most often to go to the boardwalk and concession stand to buy snacks or candy, catch fiddler crabs in the nearby tidal streams and just hang out.  There were weekly, outdoor movies, and even an occasional dance.  I think it was when Brian was 8 years old, we went to one of the dances: I listened to the music; Brian asked girls to dance (I was chicken; Brian was not).<BR/><BR/>
One of the days the whole family spent at the beach getting some sun and swimming in the wavy water.  When we got back to the campsite, my dad wanted to hang the beach towels to dry.  There was only one tree on our site, but he noticed that there was a nail sticking up on the top of the outhouse, so he tied one end of the rope to the tree and the other to the nail.<BR/><BR/>
Note: Each site had its own, one-hole outhouse that had a trap door in the back for access to the 5 gallon bucket for holding outhouse content.  Twice a week a truck came through the campground to empty everyone`s bucket.<BR/><BR/>
That night there was a rainstorm with strong winds.  In the middle of the night we were all awakened with the sound of a loud crash.  The four large beach towels were extra heavy with the rain and the wind caused the outhouse to tip on its side.  My dad went out to investigate and was not very pleased to find the outhouse contents were all on the side wall.  The truck - referred to as the `Honey Wagon` was not due to come until the next day; so the bucket was FULL. He spent at least an hour trying to clean up the mess as best he could.<BR/><BR/>
Dad was not very happy but he learned not to tie a clothesline to  that nail ever again.  In subsequent years he would tell people the story but laughed at it.</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 100): My first bicycle <BR/><BR/>
I don`t have any photos of my first 2-wheel bike, but after searching the internet, I believe this model is close to what I had:<BR/><BR/>
Columbia Firebolt Men`s Bicycle with Double Headlight and Tank - circa 1960`s - Black and White (but without the baskets)<BR/><BR/>
The unique feature of this bike that I never saw before getting it is that it was a 2-speed that shifted by gently cranking the pedal in reverse (like you were going to brake, but not).  I believe this may have used a Bendix Kickback Hub<BR/><BR/>
I got this bike for Christmas of 1960 (when I was 7 years old). 
 I used it from that day through my high school years.<BR/><BR/>
<a href="image/MyBike.jpg" target="image/MyBike.jpg"><img src="image/MyBike.jpg" alt="Larry`s first 2-wheel bike" height="200" /></a>
<BR/><BR/>
A few years later I got a speedometer to keep track of mileage and speed.  I remember a couple times after visiting cousins Christine and Gary that I would glide down Grattan Street hill in Willimansett.  The speed limit was 35 MPH, but I was passing cars.  I still scare myself when thinking about it today.<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 108.1): When and where I had my first job <BR/><BR/>
My first paying job was a park/playground attendant for the City of Chicopee, MA at Rivers Park in Willimansett - about 5 blocks from where I lived: 828 Chicopee Street.  I had this job for the summer of 1971 following my high school graduation from Eymard Prep Seminary in Hyde Park, New York.<BR/><BR/>
My duties included (but were not limited to) the following:<BR/>
  - Filling/draining the children`s wading pool [daily]<BR/>
  - hanging swings<BR/>
  - lining the baseball diamonds<BR/>
  - putting bandaids on kids` booboos<BR/>
  - playing cards with the local hippies (on rainy days when no little kids were around*)<BR/><BR/>
Note: A couple of these hippies were once my neighborhood friends and classmates in elementary school (well before they became hippies).
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 108.2): Other jobs I remember <BR/><BR/>
I had a couple summer jobs after my first jobs (see entry “When and where I had my first job”).  I had these summer jobs the summers following my first 2 years of college (Blessed Sacrament Order Novitiate in Barre, MA):<BR/><BR/>
- I worked at Milton Bradley game company in East Longmeadow, MA during the summer of 1972.  I started by supplying the assembly line workers with materials.  Within a few weeks I advanced to a die cut machine operator`s assistant.  The machine was used to cut out puzzles and game parts.<BR/><BR/>
- The summer of 1973 I worked at New England Container in Willimansett, MA which was walking distance from my mom and dad`s apartment.  I worked with corrugated paper: tying and stacking product on skids prior to shipping.  If you ever saw a New England Container box in 1973 (like a 24-pack Budweiser paper tray) it may have been handled by me.<BR/><BR/>
The shop was very hot (especially in the summer).  It was the one job my dad thought would encourage me to stay in school to get a good job.  He was right; it did!<BR/><BR/>

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 117): Family members who have been in the military and/or public service <BR/><BR/>
My dad, Roy C Sicard, was in the US Army around 1945 and later - his first “hitch” (assignment) was in what he called `Signal Corps`.  I don`t know exactly what that entailed, but I believe it had to do with managing and delivering supplies.  He was stationed in Trieste, Italy.  He didn`t speak too much about WW2, but more about his life in that area.  Some of the most memorable stories he told Brian and I included those about some of the girlfriends he had in Italy.  Here are my top three stories.<BR/><BR/>
1. He told me about the time he was socializing with some of his army buddies and their friends at an indoor roller rink.  It was summer and warm and the doors to that building were open.  After being there for a while my dad shouts to his buddies: “Follow me!”.  He went outside and down the streets of the town until he and some of the others skating off the end of a dock and into the ocean.<BR/><BR/>
2. PSA per my dad: He told me that one time he accidentally made a dinner date with two different girls on the same night at the same restaurant.  When they both showed up - needless to say - they were both a bit angry and left him alone.  He said he stayed at the restaurant and asked the waiter to continue to serve him with instructions that he did not want to see the bottom of his champagne glass to drown his sorrows.  After a while he decided to leave but as soon as he opened the outside door and the fresh air hit him, he fell on his face.  I imagine his army buddies helped him back to barracks on that occasion.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 130): Things I have learned and would like to pass on <BR/><BR/>
1. How to tie an "end splice" and an "eye splice" in a 3-strand rope:  I learned how to do this when I was about 10 years old by an "old sailor" that we were camping next to at the Hammonasett Beach State Park campground.  Once I had the knack of doing this, my dad asked me to use these splices on all our boat lines and camping tent ropes.<BR/>
<BR/>
2.How to tie a bundle with twine: I learned how to tie a bundle of corrugated paper quickly and snuggly during a summer job at the New England Container Company.  I`ve looked at several videos on the internet that show how to tie bundles but none compare to the speed and tightness that the technique I learned provides.  I will try to include instructions how to do this at some point, but, until then, I will have to show you how to do it personally.
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (not in journal): Fishing memories<BR/><BR/>
1. When I was about 5 years old, my dad took me fishing for the first time in a boat.  He got me up at about 3:00AM to have breakfast and get on the road to go to the Quabbin Reservoir in Massachusetts.  He rented a boat and put his 10HP Mercury outboard on it and we were on the water before sun-up.<BR/><BR/>
<a href="image/QuabbinReservoirMA.jpg" target="image/QuabbinReservoirMA.jpg"><img src="image/QuabbinReservoirMA.jpg" alt="Quabbin Reservoir, Masssachusetts" height="200" /></a>
<BR/><BR/>
I remember catching a few perch or bluegill that morning and having fun fishing and riding in the boat.  We were cruising to get to a different spot and in an instant I had the sensation of flying through the air and then getting wet.  Very quickly a hand grabbed the back of my life jacket and pulled me out of the water and back into the boat.<BR/><BR/>
My dad described what happened (much later, when I was a little older) was the pin that actually holds the outboard to the bracket slipped half way off - causing the boat to rock violently and through me out of the boat.<BR/><BR/>
Was my mom surprised to see me come home completely soaked.<BR/><BR/>
2. I must have been about 7 years old when dad gave me a new fishing pole with a Mitchell 300 spinning reel just like his.  I loved that pole and I still have it (but don`t use it anymore).  One time after dinner, dad, Brian (who was about 4 years old), and I walked down our street.  We were going fishing in the Connecticut River, just a short way north of the Willimansett Bridge.<BR/><BR/>
<a href="image/WillimansettBridge.jpg" target="image/WillimansettBridge.jpg"><img src="image/WillimansettBridge.jpg" alt="Willimansett Bridge, Masssachusetts" height="200" /></a>
<BR/><BR/>
Brian did not have a fishing pole at that time so dad rigged a stick with line and a hook and baited it for him and threw it in the river.<BR/><BR/>
Dad and I did not get any bites; but Brian had something tugging at his line.  Since Brian`s rig did not have a reel, my dad just told him to hold his pole and run away from the water.  After about an hour, Brian had pulled in 7 suckers and one eel.<BR/><BR/>
Moral of the story: In fishing, it is not always the gear that catches fish, but the patience.<BR/><BR/>
</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 77): An art piece that is special to me<BR/><BR/
My dad told me a story about when he was in the army.  One night he when he was assigned to guard duty, he said a German prisoner attempted to escape. My dad shot him in the leg and the prisoner was recaptured and taken to the infirmary.<BR/><BR/>
A while after that incident, the prisoner requested to see my dad - supposedly to thank him for not killing him. My recollection is that the prisoner gave my dad an 8x10 painting, on glass, of Jesus praying in the Garden of Gethsemane.
That painting was framed with crinkled aluminum foil behind the glass that gave it a unique appearance. Memories of that painting hanging on Brian and my bedroom wall are vividly in my mind to this day. I don`t know what happened to that painting (I`m certain my dad would have kept it while he was alive) but it would be something I`d like to see again some day.</TD></TR>
<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 84): Films or TV series that have influenced me<BR/><BR/>
The movie “The H-Man” I believe came out in Japan in 1958.  It was, to me, the scariest movie I ever saw.  I think I may have gone to the Willow theater (in my home town, Willimansett, MA) with some friends.  I may have been around 10 years old at the time.<BR/><BR/>
The way this movie “influenced” me was that it was the cause of many of my nightmares throughout my childhood and into my teens.  Although the American movie, “The Blob”, had a similar type monster, it had nowhere near the same effect on my dreams that “The H-Man” did.<BR/><BR/>

Many summer, Sunday drives in a car, throughout my childhood, Dad would drive through Mt Tom. Occasionally, when going through one of the picnic areas we would see my Aunt Doris, Uncle Roger (and his brother with his wife).  We could tell when they were there well before seeing them because Uncle Roger`s brother would live up to his nickname - “Smokey” - because he`d be trying to start the wood campfire.<BR/><BR/>

10 things about my Dad by Noelle
<BR/><BR/>Family is one of his most important things….and being a parent myself now, I can completely understand why we want to keep our kids close!
<BR/><BR/>I love hearing stories about his childhood!  Especially, reading the journal you’ve been writing
<BR/><BR/>“Well don’t do that….” Is now something my kids have even picked up on
<BR/><BR/>I admire how creative he would be and whip up something really yummy from leftovers….how do you do that?
<BR/><BR/>I was so proud of my dad especially when people would smile and say “oh you are Larry Sicard’s daughter” at work
<BR/><BR/>I still think it’s cool that his first language was French!  I think that is one of the reasons I love that language. 
<BR/><BR/>Whenever I go hiking in the woods and see dead trees I think back to the time he took us on Bruno’s run and he knocked over a huge dead tree. He scared the crap out of us. 
<BR/><BR/>Still have fond memories of after school snacks of crackers, jalapenos, and sometimes cheese!  Speaking of hot stuff….I`m glad he loves spicy food and shared so many amazing spicy flavors with me!
<BR/><BR/>I have so many memories of listening to you play the hillbilly song and many others as a kid on the living room floor when you’d be practicing for church.  This was well before our family sang.  I remember seeing this eagle on a cover of some book you had and I always thought it was so cool the way you’d play!
<BR/><BR/>I still think we fed the ducks popcorn at the duck pond more than one time.</TD></TR>

<BR/><BR/>	4.	Helping me with my school projects.  Being in the basement with you making a satellite for 5th grade and the game, Canabond, for 7th.  You always had a creative mind and my projects were always displayed for examples.  I like to think you played a part in my interest in creating and repairing things and building things myself instead of just buying something.  I’ll never forget the time you handed me a hammer and said “have at it” on the walls in our stairwell. 
<BR/><BR/>	5.	Sitting down and having meaningful conversations about my grades, always caring about the effort score more than the letter grade.
<BR/><BR/>	6.	Discussions about work ethic and how it’s important to follow through and give things time before making a decision to make a change.
<BR/><BR/>	7.	Cooking with you and learning how to prepare certain foods, getting recipes from you and sharing pictures of recipes that I accomplished.  This played a big part in my determination to take care of Thanksgiving in 2004 when you weren’t physically able to because of your back issues.
<BR/><BR/>	8.	Learning how to drive stick with you and always feeling supported and encouraged that I wasn’t doing a completely horrible job at it.  If you were nervous driving with us kids, you did an amazing job hiding it.
<BR/><BR/>	9.	Your sense of humor…chocolate cake!  Motorcycle song.  Jumping out of the way even though you said you’d catch me when I was afraid to jump off the diving board…
<BR/><BR/>	10.	We all know everyone’s feelings about my marriage, but I will never forget our father/daughter dance when you swung me around like Cinderella.  You made me feel special and loved despite what you thought about my getting married.

<TR style="valign:top;"><TD class="t2">Prompt (pg 906): My 70th Birthday gift - Dominique`s<BR/>
When I Think of Dad...<BR/>
1) I think of silliness.  I love the way your eyes get wider and brighter and you raise your eyebrows when receiving a treat.<BR/>
2) I think of Ice Age and our game of nudges and slaps.<BR/>
3) I think of Sunday morning grocery store trips.  I loved the one-on-one time.  Picking out donuts was a nice perk too.<BR/>
4) I think of pancakes.  I think you preferred eggs, but you made them anyway.  You let me eat the ``baby pancakes`` made from the drips.  I loved the dinosaur-shaped ones.<BR/>
5) I think of hot breakfasts on school days.  As an adult I appreciate that not every dad would take the time to do that.  I also realized that we should have suggested stirring with a whisk when making Cream of Wheat.  Mmmm, Lumps!  So many lumps!<BR/>
6) I think of sneaking sips of wine when you made spaghetti.  That didn`t stop when I got older.  Asking for sips of beer did (Yuck!)<BR/>
7) I think of catapulting off your hands into Pete`s Lake.  It was one of my first thrill rides.<BR/>
8) I think of fishing with you and Noelle.  You took all the kids in pairs.  Noelle and I were the last to go and the only ones to make a catch.  I caught 6 and Noelle caught 4.  Good things come to those who wait.<BR/>
9) I think of pie.  The Wednesday before Thanksgiving was my favorite part of the holiday.  I remember feeling cheated if I got home too late from college and they were already made.  You inspired one of my favorite hobbies.<BR/>
10) I think of Prince Charming.  Watching the way you treat Mom taught me that acts of service is a powerful love language, it`s important to stay silly, and sometimes the most direct way to the  heart is through the stomach.<BR/>

Hey dad! This is my list I had written down but I think the wording changed a little as I was talking. I love you so much!!! It was extremely challenging to make a list by the way! You’re too amazing and we all have too many good memories to narrow down into just 10 things! It was fun listening to the other siblings lists because most of them, with exception to the ones I wasn’t born for yet, are things I also love about you or also view as favorite memories! We are all so truly lucky to have you as our dad. We all always knew this and will forever cherish you. Thank you for everything you’ve done, do, and will continue to do for us. Thank you for being so loving, goofy, and sweet, and thank you for always squealing “I’m cuuute, I’m cuuuute, she says I’m cute!” every time we say you’re cute. I ALWAYS think of you any time I hear or read that word haha! I love you so much Dad! There are no words good enough for you!<BR/>
1.	I love your smile. It’s so purely sweet. The way your eyes light up and your eyebrows raise just makes me want to smile with you. (I know mom gives you a hard time about raising your eyebrows for wrinkles, but I always love when it happens because you can see your pure joy and you look so especially handsome!)BR/>
2.	I love how goofy you are. You’re always ready to make a joke and you always make the cutest face after you say it that somehow makes the joke even better.<BR/>
3.	I love listening to you mess around on your guitar. You make the guitar look easy (when it’s definitely not! Trust me, I’ve tried..), and you always come up with the neatest little diddys. I especially love the endings you add on songs. The best part of getting rained out on camping trips was going in our big dinner tent and listening to your songs like the Beverly Hills Hillbillies. (…or is it just Beverly Hillbillies? I always forget but I love that one!) You’ll always be a rockstar to me dad! (Which by the way, I wanted to make your birthday a rock start themed party and dress you and mom up like Van Halen and his groupie but no one else seemed to appreciate my brilliant idea. Oh well…)<BR/>
4.	I love what a great role model you are. You never argue in front of us and always choose the high road. You are a man of great virtue, dad. You showed Sammy how to be a great man and the rest of us girls what a great husband looks like. I think sometimes people underestimate what that kind of role model does for a person. We are so incredibly lucky that having a strong male role model isn’t even a thought because we always had you who makes it look effortless.<BR/>
5.	I love how important family is to you. You always want to be together and you always want to visit family whenever you travel. You have always been our motivation to be better when we’re fighting with each other. Any time we are mad at someone else in the family, one of us mentions how we need to let it go, specifically for you, because family is everything to you.<BR/>
6.	I love how generally loving you are. I honestly can’t think of a single time you’ve talked poorly of someone. You are such a great role model and “if you can’t say something nice you don’t say anything at all”.<BR/>
7.	I love how you’re such a kid at heart. Even after we all grew up you still always go for the kid adventure movies. I always loved walking around family video with you (when that was still a thing). I remember going with you after I left for college and you chose a kid movie called Nannie McPhee. I wondered why you chose that when “I was grown up now” but it turned out to be a pretty cute movie haha!<BR/>
8.	I love listening to your stories. You’re so expressive and such a natural storyteller. You could make any story sound fun. But it’s especially fun to hear about growing up with Uncle Brian, and when you’d get in trouble how you couldn’t take being scolded by memere seriously, or going to the beach with Pepere where there were hundreds of crabs covering the beach. Then there’s also your time camping with the priests and feeding chipmunks beer peanuts!<BR/>
9.	I love how you’d always start Saturday mornings off special with a good breakfast for us. Your dinosaur pancakes are the best. So cute that I never want to eat them but somehow extra delicious. (Probably because of the extra love you put into making them)<BR/>
10.	I love how at 33years old, I can still come home and sit on your lap and cuddle you. Because no matter how old we get, you’ll always be our dad.<BR/></TD></TR>
